This is a github-blog all about how my life got fairly fixated on learning about computer science and programming for audio applications. 

I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there and I'll tell you some fun stuff about C++, Python, maths, music, DSP and more.  

I'm interested in freelance work and other opportunities.

Here's my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CVDec17.pdf)  
And this is my [github](https://github.com/larzeitlin)
