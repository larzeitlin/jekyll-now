This is a github-blog all about how my life got fairly fixated on learning about computer science and programming for audio applications. 

I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there and I'll tell you about some fun thing I learned with C++, Python, maths, DSP and basically anything I want to write about. 

I'm interested in freelance work and other opportunities.

Here's my [CV]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/LukeZeitlinCV(Jul17).pdf)  
And this is my [github](https://github.com/larzeitlin)
