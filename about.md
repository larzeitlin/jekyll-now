This is a github-blog all about how my life got fairly fixated on trying to teach myself about computer science and programming for audio applications. 

I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there and I'll tell you about some fun stuff I learned in C++, python maths, Digital Signal Processing, and other things maybe. 

I'm interested in freelance work and other opportunities.
