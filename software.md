## CHORD

This is CHORD, a free circle of fifths based MIDI-tool for creating chord progressions and melodic patterns. It's a stand-alone app that can shoot MIDI messages into your DAW. I use it all the time for writing music, it's a bunch of fun. It's made in Processing's Python mode, wrapped as a Java application.

## Anatron interface
[This one](https://github.com/larzeitlin/Anatron-Scripter-Interface) is my first and only foray into Logic X's scripter tool. It's just a very simple mapping of sliders to CC vals in order to control a hardware filter tool called the Anatron.

The Anatron was developed by veteran audio design engineer Derek Dearden in collaboration with multi-Platinum record producer Paul Northfield, the Anatron adds authentic analog tone and sonic effects to the sound of any instrument or melody line, or to a complete mix.

## Music Calculator

This is a desktop application I made in Objective-C for performing a bunch of music-maths calculations quickly. It's pretty handy for when you just want to do some quick conversions without having to think too much.
