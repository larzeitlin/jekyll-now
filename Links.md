Here's a collection of useful links. One of the things I love about digital signal processing and related topics is the amount of materials online to teach yourself from. My favourite are below, along with some other helpful resources:


### DSP

- [Julius Orion Smith](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/) : Lecturer at Stanford. Julius' website is an online bible of DSP theory.

- [Coursera - Audio Signal Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) : A great, free online course on DSP. Mostly spectral stuff. 

- [Laurent de Soras](http://ldesoras.free.fr/prod.html) : A blog with a bunch of interesting papers on DSP stuff. 

- [Katja](http://www.katjaas.nl/home/home.html) : Slightly eccentric website. Great explanations of a bunch of maths and DSP related stuff with good illustrations. 

### Maths

- [Coursera - Calculus](https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus1) : By Jim Fowler from Ohio State University. This is probably the best taught course I've ever studied (on or offline). 

- [Better Explained](https://betterexplained.com) : Khalid has made a really great resource for tricky maths topics with this website. Caveat: I can't recommend  his Fourier Transform materials. They are a little confused in my humble opinion. 

- [MIT OpenCourseware - Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/) : Taught by Gilbert Strang. Fantastic course. 

### Programming

This is in no way a comprehensive list of programming websites I like. Just a few choice links. 

- [LearnCpp](http://www.learncpp.com) : Very clear, elegant explinations of c++ concepts. 

- [WDL Forum](https://forum.cockos.com/forumdisplay.php?f=32) : In the absence of a proper API for iPlug, trawling this forum is the best resource for learning about it.

- [Florian Le Bourdais](http://flothesof.github.io) : Blog posts on interesting subjects, mostly with Python. I don't think DSP is his main thing but he writes on a range of topics well. 

### Mastering Services

The marketplace of audio mastering is a mine-field of sham professionals. I've used many and been disappointed with most. Here are some trusted mastering services:

- [Really Good Mastering](https://www.recreationstudio.co.uk/sectors/really-good-mastering/) : Adam is my go-to-guy for mastering. Affordable, good quality, very intuitive. 

- [OOOD Mastering](http://oood.net/mastering/about-stooodio-mastering) : Colin is a consummate professional. Very reliable quality results. 

- [Hermetech Mastering](http://hermetechmastering.com) : Greg has done great work on my tracks. I highly recommend him.
