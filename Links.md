- [Coursera - Audio Signal Processing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) : A great, free online course on DSP. Mostly spectral stuff.

### Maths

- [Coursera - Calculus](https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus1) : By Jim Fowler from Ohio State University. Really fantastic teaching. Can't reccomended this enough. 

- [Better Explained](https://betterexplained.com) : Khalid has made a really great resource for tricky maths topics with this website. Caveat: I can't recommend  his Fourier Transform materials, they are a little confused IMHO. 

- [MIT OpenCourseware - Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video-lectures/) : Taught by Gilbert Strang. Fantastic course. 

### Programming

- [Florian Le Bourdais](http://flothesof.github.io) : Blog posts on interesting subjects, mostly with Python. He writes on a range of topics well. 

- [Martin Finke](http://www.martin-finke.de/blog/) : The most comprehensive beginner tutorial in iPlug out there.
