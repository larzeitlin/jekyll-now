title: Basic Delay Effects
---

A delay is usually thought of as an “echoing” sound. However digital delay lines are also used to make other effects such as comb filters. The concept that these effects rely on is feedback. 

Feedback is, intuitively, just taking the output of a process and adding the output to any new input back at the beginning. However, if we take all of the output and keep adding it to all of the input then we are in danger of the filter “blowing-up” - ie. getting rapidly and uncontrollably louder. You may have experienced this if you’ve ever held a microphone close to a speaker which is outputting the sound of the mic. This ability to make an everlasting loop illustrates why feedback filters are called “Infinite Impulse Response” (IIR) filters.

To control this feedback we can multiply the returning output by a scale factor ( < 1). This insures we don’t get a full scale version of the output going back into the input. We’ll call this scale factor “fb level”.

So the diagram above is simple enough, but it doesn’t actually tell us anything about how to cause the delay to happen. It’s just a “black box”. So, how can we implement it? First let’s look at how you might do it with one sample of delay. To do this we’ll first introduce a bit of terminology that you may know already: 


 - We’ll call our input signal x and out output signal y. 

 - To talk about a specific sample in ether we will just identify the specific sample in brackets, for example x(10), or y(3).

 - For a general sample in the signal we will use n. Samples relative to his can be referred to in relation to n, for example x(n-1) would be the input from one sample in the past, y(n+4) is the output from 4 samples in the future.


## single sample delay feedback

Right, so lets get back to the single sample delay. We can make this by just holding the previous output sample ( y(n-1) ) as a variable. Each cycle we’ll take that saved output from last time, perform calculations with it, and then save the new output for the next cycle to play with. Below is a diagram of the process by which this works.

This system works fine for one sample of delay. But what if we want longer delays? While it is conceivable to set up more storage variables (storeYn_2, storeYn_3, storeYn_4, etc) and then shuffle the values through this chain of storage every cycle, this would quickly become messy and computationally expensive. 

## Circular Buffers

The standard solution is to introduce another buffer to the system. This buffer operates in a special way, and is known as a circular buffer. As the name suggests, this buffer loops round - when the pointer that accesses it gets to the end it just loops back to the beginning. The value of this may not be immediately clear, but will become so as we go. 

Imagine this circular replacing the storeYn_1 variable in the diagram above. Now rather than having to use the y(n-1) value, the y(n) from previous cycle, we can choose the output of any previous cycle: y(n - D). The only limit is the size of our buffer. The animation below shows the circular buffer working with a delay of 3 samples:

And that, theoretically, is pretty much it! One other thing to be aware of is that you’ll want to provide a wet/dry control for the delay. This is so you can hear some of the original sound alongside the delay (as you would in reality).

## Making a basic delay effect in iPlug

Right, lets try throwing this together in iPlug so we can export it as a Audio Unit (or VST, etc).  
You’ll need to clone a branch of the WDL framework for iPlug if you haven’t already. WDL-OL is probably the most popular one, maintained by [Oli Larkin ](https://github.com/olilarkin/wdl-ol). I’m using [Youlean’s branch](https://github.com/Youlean/IPlug-Youlean)  at the moment because of it’s support for a nice graphics library called Cairo. Ether will do fine. 

I’m not going to spend ages here explaining how to set-up iPlug with your IDE of choice, there are other guides that would explain it better. Martin [Finke’s blog](http://www.martin-finke.de/blog/tags/making_audio_plugins.html) is helpful for this. If you want to build this as a VST then you will need to install the VST SDK from Steinberg. Again, Martin’s great tutorial has easy-to-follow explanations for all of this. 

We’ll start be duplicating the IPlugEffect example in the IPlugExamples folder. This can be done with the duplicate.py script in the same folder. Launch a terminal window, navigate to the IPlugExamples folder and run the following command:

￼￼```shell_session
./duplicate.py IPlugEffect/ DelayPlugin YourName
￼￼```

After duplicating the IPlugEffect the script will tell you to change the PLUG_UID and MFR_IUD.  Open the duplicate project and, in the resource.h file change those to something whatever you like (4 character codes): 
￼￼```cpp
… // http://service.steinberg.de/databases/plugin.nsf/plugIn?openForm
// 4 chars, single quotes. At least one capital letter
#define PLUG_UNIQUE_ID ‘DDLP’
// make sure this is not the same as BUNDLE_MFR
#define PLUG_MFR_ID ‘LUZE’
…
￼￼```

Before moving forward just check that this example builds. If you build the APP scheme it should launch a window that shows this plugin, which is a basic gain plugin with a bit of text and a knob on the GUI. 

Now let’s have a quick look at the layout of this plugin. Look in DelayPlugin.h.
