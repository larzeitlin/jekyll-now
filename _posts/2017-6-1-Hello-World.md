This is a first post to a) test things in and b) lay out some ideas for this blog. 

Really the perpose of it is to document things I am teaching myself, things that I come across that are interesting and, maybe, help other people who are coming from the same angle to avoid some of the pitfalls that I have stumbled into. 

Here is some pictures of projects I'm working on:

## Chord

This is [CHORD](https://github.com/larzeitlin/Chord), a circle of fifths based MIDI-tool for creating chord progressions and other great stuffs. I use it all the time in my own music.

## LearnSynth

[This is a project](https://github.com/larzeitlin/LearnSynth) I am slowly putting together using various resources including Martin Finke's iPlug tutorial, Will Pirkle's DSP book and Julius Smith's online DSP resources.

## Anatron interface
This one](https://github.com/larzeitlin/Anatron-Scripter-Interface) is my first and only foray into logic's scripter tool. It's just a very simple mapping of sliders to CC vals in order to control a hardware filter tool called the Anatron.
