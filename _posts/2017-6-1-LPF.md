title: Intuitive Understanding of a Low-Pass Filter
---

understand loads of maths to have a feel for why it works.

A LFP attenuates some of the higher frequencies in a signal. while allowing the lower ones to ‘pass’ unaffected. There is more than one way to do this, however the easiest and most common is to use destructive interference. 

Destructive interference happens when you add a positive number to a negative number. If they are of equal magnitude then the result is 0. If they are not then the result will be somewhere in between the two values. 

Digital signals are just a series of numbers (each between -1 and 1), so if you add together two signals of the same length, each ‘sample’ will be added to its counterpart in the other signal. If one signal is positive at the same time as the other is negative, they can cancel each other out. 

We can see this by plotting two sinusoids. SinA is a sine wave with 0 phase It’s the blue one. SinB, the green one, is the same sine wave but at PI phase (so half a period out of phase with SinA). Then we plot the sum of the two in red.

note: This uses a sin generating function, genSine(). The details of this aren’t important here other than understanding that it computes a sinusoid. The parameters it takes are: (amplitude, freq in Hz, phase in radians, sampling freq, duration in seconds). 

￼￼```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

sinA = genSine(0.5, 2.0, 0.0, 1000.0, 2.0)
sinB = genSine(0.5, 2.0, np.pi, 1000.0, 2.0)
sinSum = sinA + sinB
plt.plot(sinA)
plt.plot(sinB)
plt.plot(sinSum)
```

So that’s great, if we want to make something silent we can just invert it and add it to itself. This has all sorts of uses in itself (for example, to test if two sounds are identical or not), but how does this help us pull down higher frequencies more than lower ones? Before we answer that let’s look at the opposite of destructive interference: constructive interference. 

Constructive interference happens when you add together signals that have similarities to each other, just as destructive interference happened where there were differences. For example, if we add together two identical sinusoids the result will be a sinusoid of the same frequency but twice the amplitude. 

Here sinA and sinB are in green (overlapping), and sinSum is in red:

```python
sinA = genSine(0.5, 2.0, 0.0, 1000.0, 2.0)
sinB = genSine(0.5, 2.0, 0.0, 1000.0, 2.0)
sinSum = sinA + sinB
plt.plot(sinA)
plt.plot(sinB)
plt.plot(sinSum)
```

So that’s quite intuitive  - one noise plus another identical noise is a louder noise. 


Maybe you are wondering what happens when the two not ether exactly in phase or out of phase. Here are some other sinusoids with different phase relationships, and their sums (in red):  0.5*pi:

![Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/1.2 "sins - 0.5 * pi phase")

0.25*pi 

![Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/1.3 "sins - 0.25 * pi phase")

0.9*pi

![Diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/1.4 "sins - 0.9 * pi phase")

These different phase relationships reveal a trend: 

The more similar two signals are at a given point in time, the more constructive interference they have with each other, the more different they are at a given point in time, the more destructive interference. 

We can exploit this quality to filter out “different” sounds and retain “similar” ones. Let’s see how:

 The “One Zero” Filter 
This works by forking the signal into two, delaying one of the forks by one sample and then adding them back together, like so.

Now, imagine that x in the diagram above is the signal of a cosine wave who’s frequency was half of the sampling frequency. This is called the Nyquist frequency, and is the highest possible frequency that can be represented for a given sampling frequency. Imagine we are only working with 24 samples in our signal. 

Assuming it’s amplitude is 1, x’s values would be as follows: [ 1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1. 1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.]

alternating from 1 to -1 across each sample, as you would expect for Nyquist. 

If you delayed this by 1 sample, the sequence would look like: [-1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1. -1.  1.]

These two summed together would produce: [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0. 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]

So, for the highest frequency we can talk about for a given sampling frequency, the output is 0. This cancels out just like the first plot we did. This is because one sample of delay will cause Nyquist to be exactly pi phase. 

However, for lower frequencies, one sample of delay isn’t such a big difference. In fact there is going to be a whole load of constructive interference at low frequencies - this boost to low frequencies is one reason why this “One Zero” filter is not ideal for many situations. 

lets implement a simple Zero One LPF in Python, throw some different sinusoids through it and graph what comes out:
